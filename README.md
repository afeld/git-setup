# Git Setup Script

Helps install and/or configure Git with good default settings. Currently **only Mac and Linux** are supported. To execute, run this from your Terminal:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afeld/git-setup/master/setup.sh)
```

If you run into problems, run

```bash
DEBUG=1 bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afeld/git-setup/master/setup.sh)
```

and paste the output into a new [issue](https://github.com/afeld/git-setup/issues).

## Windows

For Windows setup, I recommend [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) which comes preconfigured with all of the fixes in git-setup.
